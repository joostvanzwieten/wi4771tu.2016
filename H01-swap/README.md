Homework 1: Swap
================

Write a C++ program starting from the code template
[src/swap.cxx](src/swap.cxx) that does the following tasks:

1.  Read two integer values `i1` and `i2` from keyboard using
    input-streams

        int i1; std::cin >> i1;
        int i2; std::cin >> i2;

2.  Write three different versions of a swap-function that swaps the
    values of `i1` and `i2` using

    *   A function that passes all arguments by value;
    *   A function that passes all arguments by reference;
    *   A function that passes all arguments by address.
    
3.  For each of the three swap-functions output the values stored in
    `i1` and `i2` to the standard output stream.

Verify that your program works correctly!
